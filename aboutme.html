      <div class="aboutme">
        <p>I am an aspiring Software developer cureently enrolled at <strong>Moringa School.</strong>I have always had a passion for technology from the moment I interacted with computers ,which was around 2009 when I joined Alliance Girls' High School for my secondary education.<br> I had just come from a very remote primary school, hadn't seen computers but heard alot about them. <br>I took computer Studies as a subject and really enjoyed the lessons. Though the first time I did a computer studies paper I got a grade E.<br>This did not deter me from persuing the subject. Infact it acted as motivation and by the time I completed my secondary education I was the best in my class.<br></p>
        <p>I intended to persue Software Development as my undergrad but wasnt able to due to unavodable circumstances. I instead persued something else but still had my hidden passion. I always admired ladies that worked in the tech industry. This drive led me to several avenues where I tried to apply for sponsored boot camps but didn't qualify due to stiff competition. This did not kill my hopes of getting to tech one day i embarked on a self-teaching journey. Its during this time this time that I came across<a href="https://moringaschool.com/about-us/">Moringa School</a> and knew I had found the perfect place that would steer me into the path of achieving my dreams </p>
        <p>I have three beautiful daughters, and the reason why I still decided to persue Software development is to teach them that they can be anything they want as long as they put their minds and heart to it. My husband has been my greatest support system</p>.
