         <h3> <em>About Me</em></h3>
         <p>I am an aspiring Software developer cureently enrolled at <a href="https://moringaschool.com/about-us/">Moringa School</a>. I have always had a passion for technology from the moment I interacted with computers ,which was around 2009 when I joined <strong>Alliance Girls' High School</strong> for my secondary education. I had just come from a very remote primary school, hadn't seen computers but heard alot about them. I took computer Studies as a subject and really enjoyed the lessons. Though the first time I did a computer studies paper I got a grade E. This did not deter me from persuing the subject. Infact it acted as motivation and by the time I completed my secondary education I was the best in my class</p>
         <p>I intended to persue Software Development as my undergrad but wasn't able to due to unavodable circumstances. I instead persued something else but still had my hidden passion. I always admired ladies that worked in the tech industry. This drive led me to several avenues where I tried to apply for sponsored boot camps but didn't qualify due to stiff competition. This did not kill my hopes of getting to  the tech world. I embarked on a self-teaching journey. It's during this time that I came across <a href="https://moringaschool.com/about-us/">Moringa School</a> and knew I had found the perfect place that would steer me into the path of achieving my dreams </p>
         <h3><em>Why I decided to take a programming class</em></h3>
         <p>I have three beautiful daughters, and the reason why I still decided to persue Software development is to teach them that they can be anything they want as long as they put their minds and heart to it. I also want to be an inspiration to anyone out there that dreams can be chieved with commitment and dedication. I hope to be a role model to young girls too.  My husband has been my greatest support system</p>
         <h3>My Hobbies</h3>
         <p>I love travelling to beautiful and calm destinations. I love reading during my free time too. My best of all is spending time with my family and preparing them sumptous meals</p>
